Basic URL Analysis:

Define basic checks such as URL length, presence of special characters, and protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS).
Subdomain Analysis:

Implement checks for suspicious subdomains, such as free email providers (e.g., gmail, yahoo) or random alphanumeric sequences.
Domain Reputation:

Utilize external APIs or databases to check the reputation of the domain. Flag domains with poor reputation scores as suspicious.
Content Analysis:

Consider the content of the webpage linked to by the URL. Look for indicators of phishing, such as forms requesting sensitive information or alarming messages.
Advanced Techniques:

Implement machine learning or heuristic algorithms to learn from known phishing URLs and dynamically detect new phishing patterns.
Utilize heuristics to detect patterns like typosquatting (e.g., misspelled domain names) or URL obfuscation techniques.
Cloud Service Detection:

Recognize URLs hosted on cloud services typically used for phishing, such as trycloudflare.com or similar domains.
Provide responses for when the AI should classify a URL as 'Legitimate' or 'Phishing'. For example:

Legitimate: URLs with HTTPS, reputable domains, no suspicious subdomains, and no alarming content.
Phishing: URLs with HTTP, suspicious subdomains (e.g., free email providers), poor domain reputation, alarming content, or known phishing patterns.
